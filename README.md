## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate Android developer with 7+ years of experience in building high-performance mobile applications.

I specialize in creating robust mobile ecosystems that prioritize security without compromising performance. Whether it's implementing StrongBox Keymaster, optimizing massive Jetpack Compose layouts, or designing offline-first architectures, I love solving complex problems elegantly.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me writing technical blog posts about Android internals, exploring AI/LLM integration patterns, or contributing to the developer community.
