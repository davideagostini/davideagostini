<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Davide</h1>
<h3 align="center">I like code üì± üíª</h3>

<br />

I love open source ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm a software engineer living in Italy. I have spent most of the my career (10 years) leading Android development for startups.
I love work with extremely talented people and collaborate to make products that would make an immediate impact. I have excellent work ethics and I enjoy solving difficult challenges and learning from them. I consider myself a very social individual, creative, open-minded and with a great desire to learn.

I enjoy making Android and Mac apps and share with others. Consider leaving a nice review, or a star in my repository.

My dream is to become a full-time open-source developer, create lots of free applications, release source code for free and help others become excellent software craftsmen.

Thank you for your support! üôå
